# Conditional Rendering

A simple project to show how to achieve conditional rendering in vue. The application consumes authentication api running on localhost that takes in username and password as the payload. Once the user is logged in, the resulting access token is stored in session. Header and sidebar are displayed by checking if the user is authenticated or not!
